Labs and other materials for Vanderbilt University BIOS 7323 - Applied Survival Analysis (Fall 2018)

You can clone this repo and run 'git pull' to get all the most recent materials. Jenny Bryan's http://happygitwithr.com is a good resource to get started with git & github.

Alternatively, to download files for a specific lab click on the lab folder, then the individual file, and then use the 'Raw' button to get code/data from that file (Right-click > Save As ...).

To learn more about data exploration, manipulation, and programming using the tidyverse check out [R for Data Science](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/index.html). Sections 10-12 will help with tibbles, importing data, and tidy formatting.
